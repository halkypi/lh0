UNDER CONSTRUCTION - needs some debugging as I'm struggling to get Gensim and NLTK to work properly with the standard installation.  Will try the miniconda distribution as anaconda on the Mac seems to work fine.

virtualenvÂ is used to manage Python packages for different projects. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could break system tools or other projects. You can install virtualenv using pip.

make sure that pip is up-to-date by running:

```
pip install --upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
deactivate
