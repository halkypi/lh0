# Getting Started

This is an introduction to data wrangling for legal hackers!  The material has been put together by lawyers for lawyers so we can learn to swim more efficiently in data.  The hope is this resource will grow as we build a community of makers that love the law, hacking and data wrangling. Learn more about hacker culture here: [Heros of the Computer Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003PDMKIY/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_p4wPCb9WVF2VX).
